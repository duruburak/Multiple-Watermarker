Watermarker app takes all of your images and watermarks them at once, while doing that it also takes account of several parameters like if you want a text to display together with the watermark, aspect ratio of the image, preview of the image etc.<br><br>

<h2>How to use?</h2>
You can either use it by installing through setup file (Watermarker_setup.exe) or you can just fork it into your code editor and run it there.<br><br>
First, hit Select Images button and select images as many as you want to apply a watermark.<br>
Then hit Choose Watermark button and choose a watermark image.<br><br>
